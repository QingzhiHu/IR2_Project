geomagnetic field  discussion of the mechanism suggested by morrison
by which large ionized gas clouds carrying tangled magnetic fields
are emitted from the sun and modulate the galactic cosmic rays reaching
the earth  it is shown to be more probable that smaller magnetic
clouds are intermittently ejected from the sun and slowed down by
the interplanetary gas  the velocity of accompanying unmagnetized
streams is unaffected and the different velocities account for the
observed initial and main phases of terrestrial magnetic storms the
model also explains some solar cosmic ray phenomena

that the amplifier must have a particular value of loop gain

of such an amplifier can be varied over a wide range without appreciable
