# Matchmaker Runners

We have the following main points of running experiments in the matchmaker library:

- **[train.py](train.py)** Main training runner for both re-ranking & retrieval training of all models supported by matchmaker.

- **[eval.py](eval.py)** Allows to evaluate a re-ranking model.
